For example, if you run an online music catalog, it would make sense for you be able to organize your products into Genres, Years, and Country; and then each of those into further levels of distinction, such as Hard Rock, Pop, and Classical.', 'ecpt'); ?></p>

This means that you can have one post type displayed in one manner, while another post type is displayed in a completely different way. Everything from layout to colors.', 'ecpt'); ?></p>
